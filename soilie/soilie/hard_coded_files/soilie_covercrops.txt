Winter Rye|Seed from late summer to midfall in Hardiness Zones 3 to 7 and from fall to midwinter in Zones 8 and warmer.  Along with conservation tillage practices, rye provides soil protection on sloping fields and holds soil loss to a tolerable level.|https://www.americanmeadows.com/grass-and-groundcover-seeds/winter-rye-grass-seeds?adpos=&scid=scplp4493&sc_intid=4493&gclid=CjwKCAjwtKmaBhBMEiwAyINuwO9njEejJuiUmEY8Up6YZiHVf9bsiFuhstD8vdMUxCcQ2OevAH_xLBoCploQAvD_BwE
Oats|As a fall or winter cover crop in Zone 8 or warmer, seed oats at low to medium rates. Oats take up excess N and small amounts of P and K when planted early enough. | https://hudsonvalleyseed.com/products/oats-cover-crop-seed?variant=31280926621741&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&utm_campaign=gs-2020-01-14&utm_source=google&utm_medium=smart_campaign&gclid=CjwKCAjwtKmaBhBMEiwAyINuwGPbMPAkUfCPnbJcUDUIzawXga7HG01JqJYtCP7wt5svA2MTSDfEKhoCKrQQAvD_BwE
Crimson Clover|Seed six to eight weeks before the average date of first frost at 15 to 18 lb./A drilled, 22 to 30 lb./A broadcast. As with other winter legumes, the ideal date varies with elevation. Don’t plant too early or crimson clover will go to seed in the fall and not regrow in spring until the soil warms up enough to germinate seeds. |https://www.americanmeadows.com/grass-and-groundcover-seeds/clover-seeds/crimson-clover-seeds?adpos=&scid=scplp1212&sc_intid=1212&gclid=CjwKCAjwtKmaBhBMEiwAyINuwI9M2QNo-Nu2iqWs-oSDRSj-13GNQlKdKu12tURPj0yDW4fhRReNuhoCaQ4QAvD_BwE
Brassicas|Brassicas can provide greater than 80% soil coverage when used as a winter cover crop. Some brassicas may winterkill, depending on climate and species. Forage radish normally winter kills when air temperatures drop below 23° F for several nights in a row.|https://www.deercreekseed.com/brassica-blend-food-plot-mix?gclid=CjwKCAjwtKmaBhBMEiwAyINuwKMAx4fu4q3eZPjqh1vH20XNLmDf1eR8KIFIZIY_lPlZBlKQ-C2y1hoCoDcQAvD_BwE#168=138 
Hairy-Vetch|Hairy vetch delivers heavy contributions of mineralized N (readily available to the following cash crop). Hairy vetch is more drought tolerant than other vetches. |https://www.trueleafmarket.com/search?type=article%2Cproduct%2Cpage&q=hairy+vetch 
Bur-Medic|Annual medics offer great potential as a substitute for fallow in dry northern regions of the U.S. with longer day length. Annual medics need to fix as much N as winter peas or lentils and have a competitive establishment cost per acre to be as valuable as these better-known legume green manures.|https://www.turnerseed.com/burr-medic.html
Field-Pea|Peas prefer well-limed, well-drained clay or heavy loam soils, near-neutral pH or above and moderate fertility. Field pea seed has a short shelf life compared with other crops. Run a germination test if seed is more than two years old and adjust seeding rate accordingly. If you haven’t grown peas in the seeded area for several years, inoculate immediately before seeding. |https://www.johnnyseeds.com/farm-seed/legumes/field-peas/field-peas-maxum-cover-crop-seed-2340.html?source=google_johnny_seeds&gclid=CjwKCAjwtKmaBhBMEiwAyINuwGMjSn8pzghu4685s3cVOwaQRwlm0e1ELyncD_pOrSk2X4Ivnr5LVBoC3MUQAvD_BwE
Red-Clover|In spring in cool climates, red clover germinates in about seven days—quicker than many legumes—but seedlings develop slowly, similar to winter annual legumes. Red clover is an excellent soil conditioner, with an extensive root system that permeates the topsoil. Its taproot may penetrate several feet.|https://www.americanmeadows.com/grass-and-groundcover-seeds/clover-seeds/medium-red-clover-seeds
Sorghum-Sudangrass|When sown at higher rates than normally used for forage crops, sorghum-sudangrass hybrids make an effective smother crop.  The combination of abundant biomass production, subsoiling root systems, and weed and nematode suppression can produce dramatic results.|https://www.elkmoundseed.com/elk-mound-seed/sorghum-sudangrass/?gclid=CjwKCAjwtKmaBhBMEiwAyINuwDhnpFLWTCr9PnoX_78TxZtZbTdFCB6SD8h13aW2cI2nn5AxOd-ErhoC6QMQAvD_BwE
Azolla|Azolla in association with blue-green alga anabaena can fix atmospheric Nitrogen (N) into ammonia which can be utilized by rice plant when it is incorporated into soil.|https://www.indiamart.com/proddetail/azolla-seeds-17045000055.html
Chickling Vetch|Chickling Vetch is an upright annual legume that fixes a large amount of nitrogen under drier conditions than clovers. It has excellent drought tolerance. Shade tolerance is not the best, so it needs to be grown in a more open canopy. It tolerates spring frosts well so it can be seeded early in the spring.|https://alseed.com/product/chickling-vetch/
Lentils|A winter annual, cool season, broadleaf, legume, they thrive in low moisture areas and grow upright and spreading making them good ground cover.|https://www.trueleafmarket.com/products/green-lentils-organic-cover-crop-seeds
Chickpeas|Chickpea is a cool-season, nitrogen-fixing cover crop that performs well when planted in early fall or spring. Deep tap roots condition soils. Dense foliage suppresses weeds and prevents erosion.|https://hosstools.com/product/marvel-chickpea/
Sweet-Clover|Sweetclover appears to have a greater ability to extract potassium, phosphorus and other soil nutrients from insoluble minerals than most other cover crops.|https://www.johnnyseeds.com/farm-seed/legumes/clovers/sweet-clover-organic-cover-crop-seed-977G.36.html?source=google_johnny_seeds&gclid=CjwKCAjwtKmaBhBMEiwAyINuwKMEZMgk8pFoJ8qHV6GJdnZq8NlcFUsWq7OCNM8dZ6HvdL7pFiWA4xoCi4UQAvD_BwE
